Like many, math class was one of my least favorite subjects. I had to study almost ten times as much as any other class just to be able to pull down decent grades.

Where did all that studying get me? My wife questioning how I graduated high school when I try to do the most basic math in my head.

One thing I did learn in math class is that whenever a teacher hands out homework, a quiz, or a test, they all require the same thing:  
**you need to show your work.**

But is this for your benefit or theirs?

Both! They want to know that you aren't cheating off of your neighbor, but even if you could do the problem in your head, they wanted to make sure you had the tools to solve more complex problems they would be introducing later on.

## Design artifacts = showing your work

Put simply, design artifacts are anything created during the design process that helps solve the problems you're designing for or convey information about the design to others.

### Examples of design artifacts

- Wireframes
- Sketches
- Mockups
- Journey maps / Storyboards
- Flowcharts
- Personas
- Mood Board / Style tiles
- Competitive analysis
- Interactive prototypes
- Paper prototypes
- Usability / Analytics reporting
- Concept model
- Design specs
- And many more…

## Good reasons for creating design artifacts

### Solving complex problems

When you're first starting out in design, it's incredibly important that you learn how to show your work for the same reasons your math teacher required it—it teaches you how to solve more complex design problems further down the road.

Complex problems are rarely something you can solve in your head, but even if you could, you shouldn't.

Just like in math, you need to double-check your work, but you also need to have others take a look at your work to make sure that you're even solving the right problems.

### Communicating what we want built

Most stakeholders and developers might know what functionality they want built, but they don't have the expertise to design it so it's usable and easy to look at.

Getting everyone on the same page is crucial to building a successful product, otherwise, everyone envisions something different, pulling the product in multiple directions.

These type of artifacts can be as simple as a sketch or as complex as a prototype. Generally, the closer your artifact is to the real thing, the less you have to explain—prototypes will do all the talking for you.

### Reducing initial launch risk

When you're working on a project that, by necessity, has to follow more of a waterfall workflow, it's critical that you try to get everything as correct as you can at launch to mitigate any failures that would be embarrassing, costly, or even catastrophic.

Creating numerous design artifacts will add a considerable amount of work, but it can help you think about every scenario and every emotional state of your users throughout their journey to get the design as right as you possibly can.

Most organizations don't have to worry about this as much, but certain kinds of organizations like conferences, or say NASA, can't exactly do iterative releases.

### Communicating rationale of your design

When working with larger design organizations, you often need to circulate designs, go through multiple critiques, and get approval for every single design decision. Or you might be working somewhere where you have a stakeholder or multiple people to answer to before you get a single pixel put in production. And then there are the old-school agencies that still do the "big handoff" where they try to sell the client on how good of a job they did.

Sounds like hell. But it's a situation a lot of designers are in.

I hesitated to put this in the good category, but it's incredibly helpful for people in these situations. If you have a gatekeeper to get through, you have to become really good at storytelling and selling your designs to make any progress.

However, there are some less hellish situations where this is important. If you're pitching an entirely new product within your company or to a venture capitalist, they're your gatekeeper to success, so learning how to put together a presentation that demonstrates what problems you're solving and how it will make your gatekeeper more money is key to succeeding.

## Bad reasons for creating design artifacts

### Dogma

Dogma creates absolute truths that shouldn't be questioned. Their version of truth isn't easily defendable, so the only way to ensure it persists is to indoctrinate and discourage independent thought.

Your design process shouldn't ever be set in stone just because someone told you always need to do something or follow a certain methodology.

The more experience you get working with design artifacts, the more you'll be able to start thinking for yourself and see which artifacts are more or less useful in certain contexts.

### Ego

The designer with an ego needs to show you how smart they are, so they have to make sure they get credit by documenting every single detail, creating numerous design artifacts, creating multiple presentations, and dominating every single discussion to assert themselves as superior.

Don’t be that person. No one likes that person.

Let your final product be the thing that gets judged, not your design artifacts or participation in meetings.

### Filling up time

Some designers feel like they need to always be designing.

They fill up time that otherwise would be spent doing something useful like running a usability test or observing users in the wild. If you've ever found yourself spending hours organizing all of the layers and folders in your mockup or going back and making your old mockups pixel-perfect, this is probably you.

Designing is about problem solving, but sometimes we get so wrapped up in the process, that we fall in love with creating things instead of solving things.

## Problems with design artifacts

### Artifacts become quickly outdated

Many of us are in these crazy environments where requirements are changing every week, if not every day, making most of your artifacts out of date. The more artifacts you create, the more things that need updating when requirements change. It can get to the point where you're spending more time updating artifacts than solving actual problems.

### Most are never looked at again

That pixel-perfect mockup that you spent hours perfecting, organizing the layers in your Sketch file, and creating specs for? Stakeholders rarely look at it ever again and the developer isn't likely going to look it over for more than a few minutes.

**Design artifacts are conversation pieces.**

They’re only meant to help move things along so we can get the real thing built. Don’t waste your time “crafting” a pristine design artifact. Focus on getting to the real thing as quickly as possible and iterating on that.

There's caveats to this, of course, many agencies and waterfall environments have to keep all of their artifacts up to date. But for the rest of us, design artifacts are just a snapshot of our design process.

### Used as a replacement for a conversation

Developers are often harped on for never wanting to talk to anyone, but it's just as big of a problem with designers. If your developers are only seeing the final design, you've failed to gather feedback from some of the most valuable people on your team.

**Designers and developers are really both problem solvers, but each lacks the skillset to do the other's job.**

Working together with a developer can sometimes feel a little daunting, but most of them are actually really nice and reasonable if you invite them to help solve the problem instead of telling them what to do—developers hate being code monkeys as much as you hate being a design monkey.

## Tools to reduce artifacts

### Design systems

When set up properly, design tool libraries like Sketch symbols or Figma libraries can often help you skip wireframes and low-fidelity mockups for established products where no one is still arguing about what color a button should be or how you should design an accordion.

Likewise, if you have a code component library such as Material, Bootstrap, or a homegrown solution, you can sit down with a developer and throw together a working prototype to test out a new feature or workflow in no time.

Since it's closer to the real thing, it allows you to get better user testing results and removes much of the confusion that mockups create by filling in all of the gaps.

**If a picture is worth a thousand words, a prototype is worth a million.**

### Collaborating

Pairing with your developer to polish up a design is a lot more enjoyable than sending dozens of messages back and forth, passive-aggressively circling the specs they got wrong—_again_.

Collaborating helps lead to better visual consistency as developers think in terms of templates and components and are very quick to find inconsistencies that designers often don't think about. When pressed for time, collaboration helps ensure there are no surprises and that compromises can be made quickly.

Keep the lines of communication open with your developers and you'll likely find that you need fewer mockups and you'll ship things more quickly.

## Keep a lean toolbox

Really, this whole article was a roundabout way of explaining [Lean UX](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2011/03/lean-ux-getting-out-of-the-deliverables-business/) principles. The core strategy is getting out of the deliverables business by getting to code as quickly as possible, testing your ideas with real users, and iterating based on testing and feedback.

Design artifacts are just a tool in your designer toolbox.

When you all you have is a hammer, everything looks like a nail. It's important that you become familiar with many design artifacts to ensure you choose the right tool to solve the right problem.
