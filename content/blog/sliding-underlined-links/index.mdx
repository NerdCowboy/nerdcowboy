Underlined links are as old as the web itself. The underline gives affordance to users that the text links somewhere else. By default, all links are underlined and that's good enough for a lot of websites.

However, adding a little bit of motion to an underline can create a delightful micro-animation that can help bring your website to life. (did I buzzword right?)

## Getting started #1-3

For the first three techniques, we'll be adding `position: relative` to the `a` element. This means anything that's inside of it, or in this case, it's psuedo elements, will be contained to the link's bounding box when absolutely positioned.

Then, we remove the default underline of links and set the color to something else to help denote that it's a link.

```css
a {
  position: relative;
  text-decoration: none;
  color: saddlebrown;
}
```

## 1. Slide in and back

![Example of slide in and back underline technique](/slide-in-back.gif)

With this technique, we're going to be creating a link that underlines from left to right on hover. When hovered off, the underline will slide back to the left and disappear.

We'll absolutely position the `::before` pseudo element of the `a` element to create an underline effect. Since we relatively positioned the `a` element in the beginning, this pseudo element will be contained within the space of the link itself.

In the initial state, we'll create a rectangle without any width and expand it all the way to the right on hover.

```css
/* 1.  Change left to right to reverse direction */
a::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  left: 0; /* 1. */
  bottom: -0.2em;
  height: 0.2em;
  width: 0;
  background-color: currentColor;
  transition: width 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

a:hover::before,
a:focus::before,
a:active::before {
  width: 100%;
}
```

## 2. Slide in and out

![Example of slide in and out underline technique](/slide-in-out.gif)

Hovering on a link with this technique looks exactly the same as the previous one. However, on hover-off/mouseleave, the underline will slide off to the right instead of snapping back to the left.

I discovered this technique on [Artboard Studio](https://artboard.studio) via [Land Book's](https://land-book.com/) site of the day â€” I highly recommend it for keeping up with the latest design/CSS trends.

I assumed they were using some javascript to achieve this effect as there's no native hover-off/mouse selector in CSS (though you can [use a CSS trick for certain effects](https://css-tricks.com/different-transitions-for-hover-on-hover-off/)).

To my surprise, it uses a pretty simple CSS trick. It takes advantage of the fact that the underline isn't initially visible, so you can set the hover-off styles as the default styles.

```css
/* 1.  Swap left and right values to reverse direction  */
a::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  left: auto; /* 1. */
  right: 0; /* 1. */
  bottom: -0.2em;
  height: 0.2em;
  width: 0;
  background-color: currentColor;
  transition: width 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

a:hover::before,
a:focus::before,
a:active::before {
  width: 100%;
  left: 0; /* 1. */
  right: auto; /* 1. */
}
```

## 3. Slide middle out

![Example of slide middle out underline technique](/slide-middle-out.gif)

With this technique, on hover, the line starts from the middle and extends simultaneously to the right and left edges. On hover-off, the line slides back to the middle and disappears.

The key trick to getting this to work is setting the properties `left` and `right` to 0. This has the effect of making the bounding box full width, however, we're still able to set a separate width of the underline. [Here's a technical explanation](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2013/08/absolute-horizontal-vertical-centering-css/#explanation) of how this works for those curious.

Since we can set a separate width, this allows us to center the rectangle by setting the left and right margin to auto.

```css
a::before {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: -0.2em;
  height: 0.2em;
  width: 0;
  background-color: currentColor;
  transition: width 0.2s ease-in-out;
  width: 0;
  margin-right: auto;
  margin-left: auto;
}

a:hover::before,
a:focus::before,
a:active::before {
  width: 100%;
}
```

## Always-visible underline variants

![Example of multi-line slide over the top underline technique](/sliding-variants.gif)

If you do want an underline to always be present, you can still use the first three techniques. The only difference is we need to add an an additional always-visible underline using the `::after` pseudo element.

```css
/* 1. need to bring above ::before. 
If you switch ::before & ::after, you don't need this */
a::after {
  content: '';
  position: absolute;
  bottom: -0.2em;
  height: 0.2em;
  width: 100%;
  left: 0;
  background-color: currentColor;
  z-index: 1; /* 1 */
}
```

## 4. Multi-line slide over the top

![Example of multi-line slide over the top underline technique](/slide-over-top.gif)

This technique is quite different than the previous examples and probably the most complex. I discovered this technique from [@jhey's](https://twitter.com/jh3yy) [CodePen](https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/gOPjBPM).

We have an always-visible underline, but when we hover over the link, we slide a small rectangle that appears to transverse to the right over the existing underline.

Since we're using `background-image` instead of absolutely positioned psuedo elements, it allows us to support multi-line text links.

This techniques uses 2 linear-gradients. The first gradient is the always-visible underline and the second is the small rectangle we'll be sliding over it. Since we're applying `background-image` to an inline element, we can take advantage of the fact that inline elements naturally don't show any overflow. We set `background-position-x` so that the small rectangle is shifted to the left out of view. And on hover, we change the position so that it's all the way to the right, creating the sliding effect.

You don't have to use CSS variables (aka Custom Properties), but it does make it a bit easier to update.

```css
/* Forked from https://codepen.io/jh3y/pen/gOPjBPM */
:root {
  --bg: white;
  --underline-width: 0.35em;
  --underline-block-width: 50px;
  --underline-color: #622e0a;
  --underline-color-hover: #401d05;
  --underline-transition: 0.6s;
}

a {
  color: saddlebrown;
  text-decoration: none;
  background-image: linear-gradient(90deg, var(--bg), var(--bg)),
    linear-gradient(90deg, var(--underline-color), var(--underline-color));
  background-size: var(--underline-block-width) var(--underline-width), 100% var(--underline-width);
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  background-position-x: calc(var(--underline-block-width) * -1), 0;
  background-position-y: 130%;
  transition: background-position-x var(--underline-transition);
}

a:hover {
  background-image: linear-gradient(90deg, var(--bg), var(--bg)),
    linear-gradient(90deg, var(--underline-color-hover), var(--underline-color-hover));
  background-position-x: calc(100% + var(--underline-block-width)), 0;
}
```

## 5. Slide to top

![Example of slide to top underline technique](/slide-to-top.gif)

And finally, we have another technique that also uses `background-image`, so it also has the benefit of being multi-line friendly. With this technique, we're going to have an always-visible underline. When hovered, the underline will slide up to to top of the text.

Since this underline will slide underneath the text, it's important to make sure you use colors that will pass a [contrast checker](https://colourcontrast.cc/).

To create the underline, we use a linear-gradient, but adjust the `background-size` so that the `y` value (the 2nd number) is equal the the height of the underline. Then we push the underline to the bottom using `background-position-y`. On hover, we just adjust the `background-size` to 100% to extend the underline to the top of the text.

```css
a {
  color: black;
  padding-top: 0.2em;
  background-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 10%, #d99a5a 10%);
  background-size: 100% 0.2em;
  background-position-y: 100%;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
  transition: background-size 0.2s ease-in-out;
}

a:hover,
a:focus,
a:active {
  background-size: 100% 100%;
}
```
