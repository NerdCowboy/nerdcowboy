This is a living document of the software and hardware I use, along with my office setup. I switch things up fairly often, so I'll be updating this page as I go along.

## Editor

[VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) â€” the ecosystem alone is by far the biggest reason to switch.

#### Editor Theme

- [Material Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Equinusocio.vsc-material-theme) I use this on my personal machine.
- [Night Owl Theme](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=sdras.night-owl) I use this on my work machine.
- I use [Dank Mono](https://dank.sh/) for the main editor font with ligatures turned on. I knowâ€¦ligatures. Give it a couple of weeks, trust me.

## Terminal

[iTerm2](https://iterm2.com/) I customized it by following Wes Bos' course, [Command Line Power User](https://commandlinepoweruser.com/).

**Terminal Font:**
[Inconsolata for Powerline](https://github.com/powerline/fonts/tree/master/Inconsolata)

## macOS Desktop Apps

- [Alfred](https://www.alfredapp.com/). I use their snippets and workflows pretty heavily.
- [BetterTouchTool](https://folivora.ai/) Great tool for customizing keyboard and trackpad shortcuts.
- [Franz](https://meetfranz.com/) Consolidate all of your various Slack, Messenger, Hangouts, etc messaging apps into one app.
- [Kap](https://getkap.co/) Good, quick video/screen capture tool.
- [Karabiner Elements](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/) I could probably do a lot more with this, but I map my capslock to command+shift+option+control for shortcuts.
- [Rocket](https://matthewpalmer.net/rocket/) Quickly type out emojis like you do in Slack ðŸš€
- [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/) I design mostly in Sketch these days, but really eyeing [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) & [Framer X](https://framer.com/features/react/).

## Desk Setup

- My desk is a [Steelcase Airtouch](https://store.steelcase.com/airtouch-1). It's a great desk, but I bought it before there were a lot more cheaper options, so don't generally recommend due to the price.
- My chair is an [Ergohuman ME7ERG](http://ergohuman.com/ergohuman-chair-me7erg-high-back-with-headrest-and-mesh/). I have a _really_ long torso, so most arm rests aren't tall enough for meâ€”this was the only one I found that worked for me.
- My speakers are ridonkulously old. I bought my [Logitech X-530](https://www.cnet.com/products/logitech-x-530/specs/) in college and they're still running strong. I'm not an audiophile by any means, so they get the job done for me.
- My webcam is the [Logitech HD Pro C920](https://smile.amazon.com/gp/product/B006JH8T3S/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1). It has a great picture, but I generally can't use the microphone as it doesn't have good cancelling.
- My keyboard is [Microsoft Sculpt Comfort](https://smile.amazon.com/Microsoft-Sculpt-Comfort-Desktop-L3V-00001/dp/B00CYX53QW/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1540267498&sr=8-1&keywords=microsoft+sculpt+comfort+keyboard+1531). The more "ergonomic" keyboards never felt quite right to me. this is a nice balance imo.
- My trackpad is [Apple's Magic Trackpad](https://smile.amazon.com/Apple-MC380Z-A-Wireless-Trackpad/dp/B003XLYAWC/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&qid=1540267643&sr=8-4&keywords=apple+trackpad+1). Gestures ftw. BetterTouchTool makes this trackpad actually feel magical.
